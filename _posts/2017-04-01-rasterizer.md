Made as part of a computer graphics course. The features implemented include:

* Shadow mapping.
* Liang-Barsky clipping in homogeneous coordinates.
* Texture mapping.
* Normal mapping.
* Back-face culling.
* Triangle drawing using edge functions, in cooperation with barycentric interpolation.
* Arbitrary model import using .obj files with support for .mtl files.

I worked on this alongside <a href="http://smithy.productions/"> Rory Smith</a>.
